OIL is a Solana-native store of value protocol that combines a probabilistic drilling game, lock-based staking, and deflationary tokenomics. The protocol incentivizes participation through multiple reward mechanisms while continuously reducing the circulating supply of OIL tokens.

The block-based drilling protocol on a 5x5 grid (25 squares) where users deploy SOL to claim blocks. The winning block is determined using the Entropy RNG program, which implements a commit-reveal scheme with slothash sampling to ensure verifiable, provably fair randomness. Winners share rewards proportionally based on their stake on the winning block.
