OIL is a Solana-native store of value protocol built around **continuous Dutch auction-based mining**. Bid SOL to operate one of four OIL wells and earn tokens in real-time.

When you bid, you become the operator and start mining OIL immediately. Prices decrease over time, and anyone can outbid you. When outbid, you get 86% of the new bid back.

Each bid contributes to deflation: 10% buys back and burns OIL, 3% rewards stakers, and 1% supports the protocol. This creates continuous upward price pressure while rewarding both miners and holders.
