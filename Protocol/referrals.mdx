Earn passive rewards by referring friends to OIL. When your referrals claim rewards, you earn a percentage of their claims.

### How It Works

OIL uses a **single-tier referral system**. You earn **0.5% of each claim** from both block-based and auction-based mining modes, totaling **1% across both modes**.

**Referral Bonus: 0.5% per mode (1% total)**

* **Block-based mining**: 0.5% of FOGO and OIL claims
* **Auction-based mining**: 0.5% of FOGO and OIL claims
* **Total**: 1% across all reward types

The bonus comes from the protocol's admin fee, so it doesn't cost the miner anything extra.

### Setup

1. **Create your referral account** using the `create_referral` instruction (one-time setup)
2. **Share your referral link** - when someone uses it to sign up, they're linked to you
3. **Referrer is set** when a new miner makes their first deployment or bid (permanent, cannot be changed)

### Earning Rewards

Rewards accumulate when your referrals **claim** their rewards:
* **0.5% of each block-based claim** (FOGO/OIL) → credited to your referral account
* **0.5% of each auction-based claim** (FOGO/OIL) → credited to your referral account
* Rewards are automatically transferred during the claim transaction
* Claim your accumulated rewards anytime using `claim_referral`

### Referral Account

Tracks your referral stats:
* **Total Referred**: Number of miners you've referred
* **Total FOGO/OIL Earned**: Lifetime earnings (for statistics)
* **Pending FOGO/OIL**: Claimable rewards ready to withdraw
