title: "Buybacks"
---

The buyback and barreling mechanism is the core deflationary engine of the OIL protocol. It creates continuous upward price pressure by permanently removing OIL from circulation.

### How It Works

1. **Protocol collects revenue** from drilling fees and winnings
2. **Treasury accumulates SOL** for buybacks
3. **Buyback operation** swaps SOL for OIL via Jupiter
4. **OIL is barreled**: 100% is permanently burned
5. **Supply decreases** → Price pressure increases

### Revenue Sources

* **10% of deployed SOL** → Treasury (buyback fund)
* **10% of winnings** → Treasury (buybacks)

### Buyback Operation

Treasury SOL is automatically swapped for OIL via Jupiter aggregator. Buybacks run hourly (if treasury has sufficient balance) or can be triggered manually.

### Barreling (Burning)

"Barreling" refers to the permanent burning of OIL tokens. When buybacks execute:

* **100% of purchased OIL** → Permanently burned (supply reduction)

Burned OIL cannot be recovered and creates continuous deflationary pressure.
