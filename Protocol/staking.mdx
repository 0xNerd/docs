title: "Staking"
---

The staking system allows users to stake OIL tokens and earn **FOGO rewards** from protocol revenue. Stakers earn rewards from two sources:

* **2% of round winnings** (from block mining)
* **3% of auction prices** (from auction mining)

All rewards are distributed proportionally based on your stake score.

#### Lock-Based Multipliers

Your staking rewards are determined by a **score** system: `Score = Balance × Multiplier`

The multiplier depends on your lock duration. Values between the table points are linearly interpolated.

| Lock Duration    | Multiplier  |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| 0 days (no lock) | 1.0x        |
| 7 days           | 1.18x       |
| 30 days          | 1.78x       |
| 90 days          | 3.35x       |
| 180 days         | 5.69x       |
| 365 days         | 10.5x       |
| 730 days         | 20.0x (max) |

**Key Insight**: A smaller balance with a longer lock can outperform a larger balance with no lock.

**Example:**

* 10,000 OIL, no lock = 10,000 score
* 1,000 OIL, 365-day lock = 10,500 score (higher despite lower balance!)

#### How It Works

Rewards are distributed proportionally based on your stake score. When you deposit, withdraw, or claim, your rewards are automatically updated based on the cumulative rewards factor.

* **Deposit**: Add OIL to your stake. Lock period can be set on first deposit or when adding to an unlocked stake.
* **Withdraw**: Remove OIL from your stake. Early withdrawals from locked stakes are allowed but incur a penalty based on lock duration. The penalty is burned (deflationary).
* **Claim**: Claim accumulated FOGO rewards.

#### Reward Source

**FOGO Rewards:**

* Come from **2% of round winnings** (block mining protocol revenue)
* Come from **3% of auction prices** (auction mining protocol revenue)
* Distributed proportionally based on stake score
* Claimed as native FOGO
* Provides immediate utility (gas, trading, etc.)

#### Lock Behavior

* Lock is set on first deposit or when adding to unlocked stake
* Cannot change lock period after it's set (for locked stakes)
* **Early withdrawals are allowed but incur penalties** (see penalty table below)
* Lock does NOT prevent deposits - you can always add more OIL
* **Adding more OIL to a locked stake resets the lock timer**
* Rewards accumulate regardless of lock status

#### Early Withdrawal Penalties

If you withdraw from a locked stake before the lock expires, a penalty is applied based on your lock duration. The penalty is calculated as a percentage of the withdrawn amount and is **burned** (deflationary).

| Lock Duration | Penalty |
| ------------- | ------- |
| 0 days (no lock) | 0% |
| 1-7 days | 5% |
| 8-30 days | 10% |
| 31-180 days | 25% |
| 181-365 days | 40% |
| 366-730 days | 60% |
| 730+ days | 60% (capped) |

**Note**: The penalty uses the next higher tier (no interpolation). For example, a 15-day lock uses the 10% penalty tier (8-30 days).

#### Single Stake Per User

Each user can have one stake account (stake_id = 0). This simplifies the staking experience while still providing all the benefits of lock-based multipliers and reward accumulation.
