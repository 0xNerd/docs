title: "Staking"

The staking system allows users to stake OIL tokens and earn **FOGO rewards** from protocol revenue. Stakers earn rewards from two sources:

* **2% of round winnings** (from block mining)
* **3% of auction prices** (from auction mining)

All rewards are distributed proportionally based on your stake score.

#### Lock-Based Multipliers

Your staking rewards are determined by a **score** system: `Score = Balance × Multiplier`

The multiplier depends on your lock duration. Values between the table points are linearly interpolated.

| Lock Duration    | Multiplier  |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| 0 days (no lock) | 1.0x        |
| 7 days           | 1.18x       |
| 30 days          | 1.78x       |
| 90 days          | 3.35x       |
| 180 days         | 5.69x       |
| 365 days         | 10.5x       |
| 730 days         | 20.0x (max) |

**Key Insight**: A smaller balance with a longer lock can outperform a larger balance with no lock.

**Example:**

* 10,000 OIL, no lock = 10,000 score
* 1,000 OIL, 365-day lock = 10,500 score (higher despite lower balance!)

#### How It Works

Rewards are distributed proportionally based on your stake score. When you deposit, withdraw, or claim, your rewards are automatically updated based on the cumulative rewards factor.

* **Deposit**: Add OIL to your stake. Lock period can be set on first deposit or when adding to an unlocked stake.
* **Withdraw**: Remove OIL from your stake. Only allowed if stake is unlocked.
* **Claim**: Claim accumulated FOGO rewards.

#### Reward Source

**FOGO Rewards:**

* Come from **2% of round winnings** (block mining protocol revenue)
* Come from **3% of auction prices** (auction mining protocol revenue)
* Distributed proportionally based on stake score
* Claimed as native FOGO
* Provides immediate utility (gas, trading, etc.)

#### Lock Behavior

* Lock is set on first deposit or when adding to unlocked stake
* Cannot change lock period after it's set (for locked stakes)
* Lock prevents withdrawal until expiration
* Lock does NOT prevent deposits - you can always add more OIL
* **Adding more OIL to a locked stake resets the lock timer**
* Rewards accumulate regardless of lock status

#### Multiple Stakes

Users can create multiple independent stake accounts with sequential IDs (0, 1, 2, 3...). Each stake has its own balance, lock period, and rewards, useful for separating different strategies or time horizons.
