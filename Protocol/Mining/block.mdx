Each round, miners have one minute to deploy FOGO to blocks in a 5x5 grid. At the end of the round, one winning block is chosen by the Entropy RNG program, which uses a commit-reveal scheme with slothash sampling to ensure verifiable randomness. All FOGO deployed on losing blocks is split amongst miners in proportion to the size of their claimed space on the winning block. In addition, the protocol distributes OIL rewards to winning miners based on the current emission schedule. See the [emissions](/Protocol/Mining/emissions) page for details on the dynamic emission schedule.

**Important:** No fees are taken when deploying FOGO. 100% of deployed FOGO goes to the round account. Fees are calculated and distributed when the round ends.

When rounds end, winnings are distributed as follows:

* **88.5%** → Winning Block Deployers
* **8%** → Treasury (Buyback & Burn)
* **2%** → Staking Rewards (FOGO)
* **1%** → Gusher Pool (FOGO)
* **0.5%** → Admin Fee

#### Gusher

Each round, 1% of the total winnings (FOGO) is added to the gusher pool. When the winning block is revealed, there is a 1 in 625 chance that those winning miners will also hit the gusher, distributing the accumulated FOGO gusher pool. 

**Rolling Gusher**: When a gusher is hit, 90% of the accumulated pool is distributed to winning miners, while 10% rolls over to the next gusher. This allows the gusher pool to grow over time even when it hits frequently.

If the gusher is not hit, the pool keeps accumulating and will be distributed to winning miners when a gusher is hit in a future round.

Winners receive their normal OIL reward (based on the current emission schedule) plus their share of the distributed FOGO gusher pool (if a gusher is hit), split in proportion to the size of their claimed space on the winning block.

#### Split Rounds

One in two rounds, the OIL reward is split evenly among all winning miners instead of being awarded to a single top miner.

#### Automation

The protocol supports automated deployments through executor bots, enabling hands-free operation for continuous participation.
