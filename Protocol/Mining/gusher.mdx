title: "Gusher"

The gusher system consists of a FOGO reward pool that accumulates over time and is distributed when a gusher is hit.

### The Pool

**FOGO Gusher Pool**

* Accumulates **1% of all winnings** (FOGO) every round
* Grows continuously until a gusher hits
* Distributed when a gusher is hit (1 in 625 chance)
* **Rolling gusher**: When a gusher hits, 90% of the pool is distributed and 10% rolls over to the next gusher

### How It Works

**Gusher (1 in 625 chance)**

* When a gusher is hit, **90% of the accumulated FOGO gusher pool** is distributed to winning miners
* The remaining **10% rolls over** to the next gusher, allowing the pool to grow over time
* Winning miners receive their normal OIL reward **plus** their share of the distributed FOGO gusher pool
* Rewards are split proportionally based on stake on the winning block

If no gusher is hit, the pool continues accumulating for future rounds.

### Example Scenario

**Gusher Hits**

After 50 rounds without a gusher:

* FOGO pool: Accumulated 1% of all winnings from 50 rounds

When a gusher hits (1 in 625):
* **90% of the accumulated FOGO** is distributed to winning miners proportionally based on their stake on the winning block
* **10% remains in the pool** and continues to accumulate with future 1% contributions
