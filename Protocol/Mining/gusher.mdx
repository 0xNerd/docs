title: "Gusher"

The gusher system consists of a FOGO reward pool that accumulates over time and is distributed when a gusher is hit.

### The Pool

**FOGO Gusher Pool**

* Accumulates **1% of all winnings** (FOGO) every round
* Grows continuously until a gusher hits
* Distributed when a gusher is hit (1 in 325 chance)

### How It Works

**Gusher (1 in 325 chance)**

* The FOGO gusher pool is distributed to winning miners
* Winning miners receive their normal OIL reward **plus** their share of the accumulated FOGO gusher pool
* Rewards are split proportionally based on stake on the winning block

If no gusher is hit, the pool continues accumulating for future rounds.

### Example Scenario

**Gusher Hits**

After 50 rounds without a gusher:

* FOGO pool: Accumulated 1% of all winnings from 50 rounds

When a gusher hits (1 in 325), all accumulated FOGO is distributed to the winning miners proportionally based on their stake on the winning block.
