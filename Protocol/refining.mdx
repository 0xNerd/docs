title: "Refining"

OIL uses a refining system to reward drillers who are patient and hold their drilling rewards longer.

Instead of receiving instantly "final" OIL, your drilling rewards are first tracked as crude OIL.

**Crude OIL**

When you win a round or deploy to the winning block, you earn crude OIL.

**Claim = Refining (10% fee)**

When you press Claim, the protocol:

* Converts your Crude OIL into refined OIL
* Takes a 10% refining fee on the amount you claim

**Who gets the 10% fee?**

* It is redistributed to all drillers who still hold crude OIL (have not claimed yet), proportional to their crude balance.

**Refined OIL**

Refined OIL is fee-free and accumulates automatically as others claim their crude OIL. When you claim, you receive 100% of your refined OIL plus 90% of your crude OIL (after the 10% fee).
