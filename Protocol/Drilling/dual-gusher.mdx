title: "Dual-Gusher"
---

The dual gusher system consists of two separate reward pools that accumulate over time and are distributed when a gusher is hit. There are two types of gushers: a full gusher (both OIL and SOL) and a SOL-only gusher.

### The Pools

**OIL Gusher Pool**

* Accumulates **+2 OIL** every round
* Grows continuously until a full gusher hits
* Only distributed when a full gusher is hit (not SOL-only gusher)

**SOL Gusher Pool**

* Accumulates **1% of all winnings** (SOL) every round
* Grows continuously until any gusher hits
* Distributed when either a full gusher or SOL-only gusher hits

### How It Works

There are two types of gushers that can be hit:

**Full Gusher (1 in 625 chance)**

* Both OIL and SOL gusher pools are distributed
* Winning drillers receive their normal OIL reward (up to 1 OIL) **plus** their share of both accumulated pools
* Rewards are split proportionally based on stake on the winning block

**SOL-Only Gusher (1 in 325 chance)**

* Only the SOL gusher pool is distributed
* The OIL gusher pool continues accumulating (not distributed)
* Winning drillers receive their normal OIL reward (up to 1 OIL) **plus** their share of the accumulated SOL gusher pool
* Rewards are split proportionally based on stake on the winning block

**Important:** If both gushers hit in the same round (extremely rare), the full gusher takes precedence and both pools are distributed.

If no gusher is hit, both pools continue accumulating for future rounds.

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Full Gusher Hits**

After 100 rounds without a gusher:

* OIL pool: 200 OIL (2 × 100)
* SOL pool: Accumulated 1% of all winnings from 100 rounds

When a full gusher hits (1 in 625), all accumulated OIL and SOL are distributed to the winning drillers proportionally.

**Scenario 2: SOL-Only Gusher Hits**

After 50 rounds without a gusher:

* OIL pool: 100 OIL (2 × 50) - **continues accumulating**
* SOL pool: Accumulated 1% of all winnings from 50 rounds

When a SOL-only gusher hits (1 in 325), only the accumulated SOL is distributed. The OIL pool remains and continues growing for the next full gusher.

**Scenario 3: Both Hit (Rare)**

If both gushers hit in the same round, the full gusher takes precedence:

* Both OIL and SOL pools are distributed
* This is treated as a normal full gusher event
