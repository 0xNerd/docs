title: "Pool Mining"
---

Pool mining allows multiple miners to combine their SOL deployments into a shared pool, reducing individual risk and enabling smaller players to participate.

### How It Works

When you deploy with the pool option enabled, you still choose which squares to deploy to (just like solo mining). Your SOL is deployed to your selected squares, but those deployments are also added to the round's pool.

The pool aggregates all pool members' deployments across all squares. This means:

* Each pool member independently chooses their own squares
* The pool tracks which squares have been covered by any pool member
* The pool wins if at least one pool member selected the winning square
* If no pool member selected the winning square, all pool members lose their deployment

### Square Selection

**You choose your own squares** - Pool mining doesn't mean the pool chooses squares for you. Each pool member selects which squares to deploy to, just like solo mining. The pool benefits from diversification: more members means more squares are likely to be covered, increasing the pool's chance of hitting the winning square.

### Pool Rewards

Pool members share rewards proportionally based on their contribution to the total pool:

* **Your Share** = (Your Pooled Deployment / Total Pool Deployment) × Pool Rewards

The pool receives rewards only if it had deployments on the winning square. If the pool didn't cover the winning square, pool members lose their deployment.

### Reward Distribution

Pool rewards include:

* **SOL Rewards**: Your share of the pool's SOL winnings (from dry blocks)
* **OIL Rewards**: Your share of the pool's OIL rewards
* **Gusher Rewards**: Your share of the pool's SOL gusher payout (if gusher hit)

All rewards are distributed proportionally when you checkpoint, based on your contribution to the total pool.

### Risk Sharing

Pool mining reduces individual risk by spreading deployments across multiple participants. However, the pool only wins if it covers the winning square—if the pool misses, all pool members lose their deployment.
