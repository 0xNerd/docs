title: "Referrals"

Users can earn rewards from their referrals' claimed rewards through OIL.

Referring friends onto OIL is a great way to earn passive rewards. When someone you refer signs up and begins mining, you earn a percentage of their claimed rewards (both SOL and OIL).

### How It Works

OIL uses a **single-tier referral system** where you earn rewards directly from miners you refer.

**Referral Bonus: 1.0%**

When a referred miner claims rewards (both SOL and OIL), **1.0% of each claim** is credited to your referral account. This bonus comes from the protocol's admin fee, so it doesn't cost the miner anything extra.

#### Setting Up Referrals

1. **Create Your Referral Account**
   * Anyone can create a referral account to become a referrer
   * Use the `create_referral` instruction (available in UI, CLI, or SDK)
   * This is a one-time setup that creates your referral account on-chain
2. **Share Your Referral Link**
   * Your referral link contains your wallet's public key
   * When someone uses your referral link to sign up, they'll be linked to you as their referrer
3. **Referrer Assignment**
   * When a new miner makes their **first deployment**, they can set a referrer
   * Once set, the referral relationship is **permanent** and cannot be changed
   * Self-referrals are prevented (you cannot refer yourself)
   * The referral account must exist before a miner can be referred (created via `create_referral`)

#### Earning Rewards

* Rewards accumulate when your referrals **claim** their rewards (not on deployment)
* **1.0% of each SOL claim** is credited to your referral account's `pending_sol`
* **1.0% of each OIL claim** is credited to your referral account's `pending_oil`
* Rewards are automatically transferred to your referral account during the claim transaction
* You can claim your accumulated rewards at any time using the `claim_referral` instruction

#### Referral Account

Each referral account tracks the following metrics:

* **Total Referred**: Number of miners directly referred by you
* **Total SOL Earned**: Lifetime SOL earned from all referrals (for statistics)
* **Total OIL Earned**: Lifetime OIL earned from all referrals (for statistics)
* **Pending SOL**: Claimable SOL rewards (accumulated from referral claims)
* **Pending OIL**: Claimable OIL rewards (accumulated from referral claims)

#### Claiming Rewards

Use the `claim_referral` instruction to claim your accumulated rewards:

* Claims both pending SOL and OIL in a single transaction
* SOL is transferred directly to your wallet
* OIL is transferred to your associated token account (ATA)
* After claiming, pending balances are reset to zero

#### Example

```
Alice refers Bob to OIL.

Bob drills and earns rewards:
- 100 SOL
- 50 OIL

When Bob claims:
- Bob receives: 100 SOL + 50 OIL (full amount)
- Alice's referral account receives: 1.0 SOL + 0.5 OIL (1.0% bonus)

The 1.0% bonus comes from the protocol's admin fee, so Bob pays nothing extra.
```

#### Important Notes

* **Permanent Relationship**: Once a miner is referred, the referrer cannot be changed
* **Only New Miners**: Referrals can only be set when creating a new miner account (first deployment)
* **Referral Account Required**: The referrer must have created their referral account before someone can be referred
* **Claim-Based Rewards**: Rewards only accumulate when referrals claim their rewards, not on deployment
* **No Cost to Miner**: The referral bonus comes from the protocol's admin fee, so miners don't pay extra
