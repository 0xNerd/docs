OIL tokens are minted through gameplay rewards, with a maximum supply of 21 million tokens. The emission schedule is designed to gradually decrease over time, creating scarcity as the protocol matures.

### Emission Schedule

The protocol uses a **weekly halving** system that automatically reduces emissions every week:

* **Week 0**: 50 OIL per round
* **Week 1**: 40 OIL per round
* **Week 2**: 30 OIL per round
* **Week 3**: 20 OIL per round
* **Week 4+**: 10 OIL per round (floor)

Emissions decrease by **10 OIL per week** until reaching the floor of **10 OIL per round**, which is maintained indefinitely.

### Emissions Per Round

| Week | Emission Per Round |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| 0    | 50 OIL              |
| 1    | 40 OIL              |
| 2    | 30 OIL              |
| 3    | 20 OIL              |
| 4+   | 10 OIL              |

### Automatic Weekly Updates

The emission week is automatically updated during the `reset` instruction when a week has passed since the last update. This ensures the emission schedule progresses without manual intervention, creating predictable and transparent token distribution.

### Maximum Supply

The protocol has a **hard cap of 21 million OIL tokens**. Once this supply is reached, no further tokens will be minted, regardless of the emission schedule. This mirrors Bitcoin's 21M supply cap, positioning OIL as a Solana-native store of value.
