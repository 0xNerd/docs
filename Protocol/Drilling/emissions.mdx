title: "Emissions"
---

OIL tokens are minted through gameplay rewards, with a maximum supply of 21 million tokens. The emission schedule is designed to maintain sustainable token distribution while allowing for adaptive adjustments based on protocol needs.

### Round Rewards

Each round distributes **200 OIL** as rewards to drillers participating in the block-based drilling system.

### Reward Halving

The round reward of 200 OIL is not a permanent value. The protocol includes a halving mechanism that can reduce emissions over time to maintain long-term sustainability and token value.

**How it works:**

* **Dynamic adjustments**: The halving mechanism can be activated or modified in response to evolving market dynamics, such as token price movements, supply growth patterns, and overall ecosystem health
* **Decentralized control**: Changes to emission parameters are determined through community governance, giving drillers and token holders a voice in shaping the protocol's economic model

### Maximum Supply

The protocol has a **hard cap of 21 million OIL tokens**. Once this supply is reached, no further tokens will be minted, regardless of the emission schedule. This mirrors Bitcoin's 21M supply cap, positioning OIL as a Solana-native store of value.
