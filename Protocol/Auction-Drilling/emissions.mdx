title: "Emissions"
---

Halving events occur every 28 days, where the entire map's mining rate is reduced by 50%. This mechanism is inspired by Bitcoin's halving model and is designed to control token inflation, promote scarcity, and ensure the maximum supply of 21,000,000 OIL is reached gradually.

* **Initial mining rate**: 5.0 OIL/s (distributed as 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 across the wells).
* **Post-Halving**: After each halving, the mining rate for each well is halved, reducing overall emissions.
* **Impact**: Increasing token value over time as mining rewards decrease, encouraging early participation and long-term holding.
* **Schedule**: Halving every 28 days
