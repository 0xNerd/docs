Halving events are supply-based, occurring when total auction OIL minted reaches specific thresholds. This mechanism directly controls token supply while maintaining long-term mining viability, promoting scarcity, and ensuring sustainable token distribution.

* **Supply-Based Halving**: Halvings occur at cumulative OIL milestones: 1M, 2.5M, 5M, 10M, 20M, 40M, etc. (exponential thresholds)
* **Post-Halving**: After each halving, the drilling rate for each well is reduced by 25% (multiplied by 0.75), reducing overall emissions gradually.
* **Impact**: Increasing token value over time as drilling rewards decrease, encouraging early participation and long-term holding while maintaining profitability longer than traditional 50% halving.
* **Supply Control**: Directly ties halving events to total OIL minted, ensuring meaningful supply control regardless of mining activity levels.
