title: "Emissions"

Halving events occur every 28 days, where the entire map's drilling rate is reduced by 25%. This less aggressive halving mechanism is designed to maintain long-term mining viability while still controlling token inflation, promoting scarcity, and ensuring sustainable token distribution.

* Post-Halving: After each halving, the drilling rate for each well is reduced by 25% (multiplied by 0.75), reducing overall emissions gradually.
* Impact: Increasing token value over time as drilling rewards decrease, encouraging early participation and long-term holding while maintaining profitability longer than traditional 50% halving.
* Schedule: Halving every 28 days with 25% reduction per halving event.
