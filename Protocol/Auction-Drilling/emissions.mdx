title: "Emissions"

Halving events occur every 28 days, where the entire map's drilling rate is reduced by 50%. This mechanism is inspired by Bitcoin's halving model and is designed to control token inflation, promote scarcity, and ensure sustainable token distribution.

* Initial drilling rate: 3.80 OIL/s total (distributed as 0.20 OIL/s for Seep, 0.60 OIL/s for Flow, 1.20 OIL/s for Gusher, and 1.80 OIL/s for Blowout).
* Post-Halving: After each halving, the drilling rate for each well is halved, reducing overall emissions.
* Impact: Increasing token value over time as drilling rewards decrease, encouraging early participation and long-term holding.
* Schedule: Halving every 28 days
